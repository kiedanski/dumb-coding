# Dumb Coding

The objective of this initiative is to force me to remember how to code without the help of AI.

I use AI daily for my day job and I hardly code more than a few lines myself. I can tell how this affects my ability to reason about code. Let alone coding.

At the same time, I have been spending most of my time in Python, and it has
been several years since I have had to learn a new programming language.

The aim of this project is to tackle the two problems at once.


## Project 1: [Shortest path in Rust](shorterst-path-in-rust/)

Rust looks like a very cool language. For this first project I'll try to write a
program that reads a graph from a text file, loads it into memory and computes
the shortest path between two pair of nodes.
